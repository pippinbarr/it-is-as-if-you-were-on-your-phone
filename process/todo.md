# To-do

## Big questions

- **We're doing it, don't worry** ~~Zen versus Social Camouflage?~~
    - ~~What about "Zen Mode" as a thing; it makes total sense~~
    - ~~Gongs and Acts that are meditative and more spaced out~~
- **I think it's the happy marriage of "both" - words and icons to start with, then just icons ~~Words versus Icons for communicating tasks?~~
    - ~~I'd assumed icons were better (more attractive), but is there a power to the blankness and clarity of words? A lack of glamour?~~

## Research

- ~~Spend some time on my phone just trying to see typical interactions and interaction clusters and interaction sequences~~
- **This is likely more important for when I'm working on the suite?** ~~Spend time in specific apps and take notes on typical interaction~~

## Visual design

- ~~Do some sketches of how this could look in terms of the actual screens and most especially the interaction indicators~~
- ~~Make some visual prototypes in Keynote or similar~~
- ~~How to indicate "swipe" and "scroll" ~~
    - **Yes but only for now** ~~Is this sort of "fixed for now" with the arrow plus scrollbar?~~
- ~~Make more visual prototypes~~
    - **I think this was misleading for this project, may bring it back for the Suite** ~~Specifically explore more iconic representation? "Text" that is just lines across the screen, images as boxes, ... very different universe but perhaps it would work... in a way even more pleasingly abstract? (At what point would it make more sense to implement it as a webpage though... hmmmmmmmmm)~~
- ~~Spend more time on the representation (swipe vs. pan is a big one)~~

## Prototyping

- ~~Checking on proportional positioning and sizing and a resizing canvas~~
- ~~Checking on basic feel of random-location bubble popping (plus points?)~~
- ~~Explore Zen sound effects~~
- ~~Explore simple animations for feedback~~
- ~~Exploration of swipe~~
- ~~Esablish "modes"~~
- **Calling them "acts" for now** ~~Add instructions for face etc.~~
- **Feels good, though can be tweaked** ~~Checking on the feel of "keyboard input" idea~~
- ~~Activities and a general state/modular model~~
- ~~Scrolling (think about the relationship of pan and swipe)~~
- ~~Bring in a second activity (Dating?)~~
- ~~Inter-interaction delay system~~
- ~~Bring back acting~~
    - ~~Try it out with a serial mode (e.g. an act is another interaction - will need to change the overall structure of that system to have an "action" base class with acts and interactions subclassed?)~~
- ~~Bring in typing~~
- ~~Switching activities~~
- ~~Bring in Instagram (incl. double tap)~~
- ~~Set up a more generic activity of "Being on your phone" that mixes and matches everything randomly~~
- ~~Add Look at this box interaction~~
- ~~Add Look Here locational interaction~~
- ~~Add splash of colour~~

- Animate swipes
- Fix scroll representation which is now a "drag"

## Writing

- Work on the Acts, build up a big set
- Contemplate Tracery?

## Actually building

- ~~Make the whole thing responsive in the OOP model~~

- Add Zen Mode (what is "actually building"???)

## Issues

- **I think so anyway?** ~~Remove text selection on the page~~
- ~~Think about "modes" that correspond to specific UIs, this could build toward the bigger "ecosystem" idea~~
- ~~Think about thumb radius (most of the time UIs don't require interactions further than a thumb away?)~~
- **SEEMS TO BE SOLVED** ~~Lag on press on mobile (same as the debug view, so testable)~~
    - ~~This remains a problem after some initial testing~~
    - ~~Further testing makes me think this is a series issue, at least in p5 seems to come down to whether a conditional is evaluated or not which... seems insane to me~~
    - ~~Even further reflection has me wondering about using a different library (PixiJS?)~~
- Was being caused by the interaction being cleared but the pan still triggering ~~Crash on holding a pan at the bottom of a scroll?~~

- If you hold a pan it seems to hold over to the next interaction which feels a bit wrong? Like we need to require a touch up first? 
- Also if you hold a pan it seems to manage to scroll up sometimes when you mean down or..?
- Need better control over where taps (and all elements generate), e.g. x y
- Sometimes on mobile it gets to a state where the page scrolls instead of the ui element...
