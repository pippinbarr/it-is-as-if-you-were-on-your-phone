# To-do

## Big questions
- Zen versus Social Camouflage?
    - What about "Zen Mode" as a thing; it makes total sense
- Words versus Icons for communicating tasks?
    - I'd assumed icons were better (more attractive), but is there a power to the blankness and clarity of words? A lack of glamour?

## Research

- ~~Spend some time on my phone just trying to see typical interactions and interaction clusters and interaction sequences~~

- Spend time in specific apps and take notes on typical interaction
    - Instagram
    - Browser
    - TikTok
    - Facebook
    - Messages
    - BlueSky/generic social media?
    - Discord/Slack

## Visual design

- ~~Do some sketches of how this could look in terms of the actual screens and most especially the interaction indicators~~
- ~~Make some visual prototypes in Keynote or similar~~

- Make more visual prototypes
- How to indicate "swipe" and "scroll" 
- The bigger question of language and/or symbols

## Prototyping

- ~~Checking on proportional positioning and sizing and a resizing canvas~~
- ~~Checking on basic feel of random-location bubble popping (plus points?)~~
- ~~Explore Zen sound effects~~
- ~~Explore simple animations for feedback~~
- ~~Exploration of swipe~~
- ~~Esablish "modes"~~
- **Calling them "acts" for now** ~~Add instructions for face etc.~~
- **Feels good, though can be tweaked** ~~Checking on the feel of "keyboard input" idea~~

- Double-tap
- Scrolling (think about the relationship of pan and swipe)
- Switching activities

## Issues

- **I think so anyway?** ~~Remove text selection on the page~~
- ~~Think about "modes" that correspond to specific UIs, this could build toward the bigger "ecosystem" idea~~
- ~~Think about thumb radius (most of the time UIs don't require interactions further than a thumb away?)~~
- **SEEMS TO BE SOLVED** ~~Lag on press on mobile (same as the debug view, so testable)~~
    - ~~This remains a problem after some initial testing~~
    - ~~Further testing makes me think this is a series issue, at least in p5 seems to come down to whether a conditional is evaluated or not which... seems insane to me~~
    - ~~Even further reflection has me wondering about using a different library (PixiJS?)~~
