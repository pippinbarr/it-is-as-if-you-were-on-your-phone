# To-do

## Presearch

- ~~Spend some time on my phone just trying to see typical interactions and interaction clusters and interaction sequences~~

## Visual design

- ~~Do some sketches of how this could look in terms of the actual screens and most especially the interaction indicators~~

## Prototyping

- Checking on proportional positioning and sizing and a resizing canvas
- Checking on basic feel of random-location bubble popping (plus points?)
- Checking on the feel of "keyboard input" idea
- Exploration of swipe (and "throw"?)
