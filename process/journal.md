## Starting point (2024-01-07)

Took some time to think about this by making notes in Things on my phone:

> Points for duration  
> Popping bubbles as typing   
> Precision scrolling  
> Taps and double taps  
> Swiping left and right  
> Donâ€™t fixate too much on it being realistic, just cycling through those ideas  
> Plus emotional instructions  
> Pauses/waits  
> Taps in other places on the screen  
> Game like interactions? Angry birds, fruit ninja, etc? Associated emotions or just random? > I think random right? What is the general affect of a phone user? Take notes. Occasional > smile but mostly dead looking or serious or furrowed?  
> Is there a game over?  
> Are there leaderboards?  
> Can you quit?  
> Keep it fucking simple?  
> Double tap bubble style  
> Some kind of minimalist abstract language of input  

Made a p5 template project which is where we are now. I'll start with that assumption and go from there.

Question: what to do about desktop? Have "it is as if you were on your computer" too which the same stuff but some different interactions? Yes makes sense. But separate projects I suppose. One after the other. Phone first because it's funnier. Computer one is the opposite of Boss Mode which is fun.
