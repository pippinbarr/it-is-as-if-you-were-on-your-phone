## Description

*Look at you! On your phone! But you've got a secret! And you won't tell! You're not on your phone! It is only as if you were on your phone! You're just pretending to be on your phone! On your phone!*

*It is as if you were on your phone* is an *almost speculative* game about an *incredibly near future* in which we're all simultaneously under significant pressure to be on our phones all the time, but also to not be on our phones all the time. Our fingers want to touch the screen, our eyes want to watch the surface, our brains want to be occupied efficiently and always. But it's also exhausting liking photos, swiping profiles, watching short-form video, and everything else we're always doing. *It is as if you were on your phone* presents an alternative: *pretend* to be on your phone so that you pass as human, but actually do essentially nothing instead. Follow the prompts and be free.

*It is as if you were on your phone* was created using [p5](https://p5js.org) along with [Hammer.js](https://hammerjs.github.io/) for touch gestures.
